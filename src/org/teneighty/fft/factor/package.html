This packages various support classes need to do integer factorization. Somehow, this package ended up being 
much larger than I anticipated (or wanted). In fact, all this garbage used to be in
<code>org.teneighty.fft</code>, but then <i>we lost control of the greens</i>, and I had to move it to 
another package, with apologies to Ernie Els.
